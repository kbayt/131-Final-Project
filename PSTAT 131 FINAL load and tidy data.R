# replace missing values with NA

# removing observations with NA (about 2000 observations)
## best option bc missing values were typically 
## movie viewability rating, budget, and gross income
## all predictors that i think will have largest effect on 
## predicting IMDb rating

# can now view month released as categorical variable
# factored so that can view seasonality better 
ggplot(movies1, aes(x = month_released)) +

### combine unrated and non rated rating into same category
movies1[movies1 == "Unrated"] <- "Not Rated"

# factor rating into levels to organize from child viewing
## to adult
movies1$rating <- factor(movies1$rating, levels = c(
  "G", "PG", "PG-13", "TV-MA", "R", "X", "NC-17", "Not Rated"))
### want to factorize so can order in such a way we divide up into subgroups of age
### that is easy to visualize 

# rename country -> country_created
# rename year -> year_created 
movies1 <- movies1 %>% rename(country_created = country, 
                   year_created = year)
view(movies1)

# turn year_released into numeric 
movies1$year_released <- as.numeric(movies1$year_released)
view(movies1)

# remove year_created (positive 1 correlation with year_released)
movies1 <- subset(movies1, select= -year)
